Hi! I'm currently a Ph.D. student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/) studying computational applied mathematics.

Broadly, I'm interested in network dynamics and high-performance numerical methods. Currently, I'm working with [Caitlin Lienkaemper](https://lienkaemper.github.io/) on random [CTLNs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196885823001707).
